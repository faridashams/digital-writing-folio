Read (on top of the weekly readings):

- The kinetic poem ["Taroko Gorge"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=taroko-gorge)
    * In _Taroko Gorge_ by Nick Monfort, my first thought as I clicked ‘begin’ on the poem, was that the colours don’t go together and it is hurting my eyes a little. It felt overwhelming to look at. I quickly realised it is a poem that doesn’t end. I am not a massive poetry reader, so I get a sense that I don’t understand them quickly, and it takes me a while to feel engaged with a piece of poem. Naturally, I didn’t feel myself gravitated toward this one, but I appreciate how infinite it is, how it challenges the norm of a poem, and even if the reader doesn’t digitally interact with it, the meaning still change with every stanza. 

- The electronic poem ["The Gathering Cloud"](https://luckysoap.com/thegatheringcloud/)
    * In _The Gathering Cloud_, I’m unsure on how I feel about this piece of work as well. Again, with it being a poem, I find them hard to navigate. However, this one is more reader interactive friendly, which helps me paint a picture to what is electronic literature as I’m still battling with that term. I’m starting to understand that electronic doesn’t have to be linear, it can be experimental and fragmented and bizarre. Clicking on certain words and then getting bombarded with pictures that resemble that word was an interesting experience, though I’m unsure it’s glitching because it’s old or if it’s my laptop. Perhaps it’s part of the aesthetic?

- The hypertext fiction ["First Draft of the Revolution"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=first-draft-of-the-revolution)
    * In _First Draft of the Revolution_ by Emily Short and Liza Daly, I think this is the one I feel connected to the most. First because it is in a genre I favour, and because I appreciate the aesthetics of it, how it appears like an old storybook telling a fable. Getting to click on different sentences that lead to a secret scroll with a hidden message was fascinating to me, and I find myself thinking how I can incorporate that into my own work. This work helps me understand that a reader can be a participant, they aren’t just an observer or an interpreter, their input serves a purpose in the story. It is almost as if the reader can rewrite the story to fit their own narrative. This piece of work is painting electronic literature and digital writing in a better light, because until now, it feels intimidating to me, but this work shows me it could be fun, that I could be as experimental as I want, because I am not restricted as I am if I was just writing a traditional narrative fiction story.

- The interactive fiction work ["Shade"](https://pr-if.org/play/shade/)
    * In Shade by Andrew Plotkin, I found this the hardest to interact with. I wasn’t sure which direction I was going in. I don’t think the main character even knew himself which direction he was going in. I found myself getting frustrated with the continuous ‘that’s not a verb I recognise.’ I read "Enlightening Interactive Fiction: Andrew Plotkin’s Shade" by Jeremy Douglass to help me better understand how the narrative unfolds and what I was supposed to be doing, but it all felt extremely frustrating to me and I wanted to give up on trying to reach the end. This really put into perspective how digital writing can achieve just about anything. But it also made me think: how did the creator know the player was going to reach the end? Did he assume the player to be as smart as him? Did the creator himself feel frustrated with the many choices and possibilities he implemented? So many questions! 


### Reading

* [Blackout Poetry Tool](https://collection.eliterature.org/4/blackout-poetry-tool) by Jazer Chand [Volume 4 (June 2022)](https://collection.eliterature.org/4/)

-  What makes the work a piece of digital writing:
    * A work becomes a piece of digital writing when it uses  a digital medium to make up its form. It becomes essential to its meaning or function. This work uses a digital functionality where the player is able to blackout words themselves, or choose a bot to do it for themselves and it generates a peom. Here is how I interacted with it. This blackout poetry used The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald.

-  A personal response:
    * I have mentioned before that I am not a poetry reader or a poetry enjoyer, but my first introduction on blackout poetry was in a book called Vicious by V. E. Schwab. The main character, Victor, used to black out all the books he owned. It fascinated me how you can come out with a new different meaning just by blacking out some words. Getting to attempt doing that with this piece was exciting as I finally tried my hand at it. I don't necessarily know how to feel about the work itself, but I enjoyed the experience of blackout poetry.

Espen J. Aarseth, Cybertext : perspectives on ergodic literature (1997)
Aarseth, E, J. (1997). _Cybertext : perspectives on ergodic literature_. Johns Hopkins University Press. 

Ergodic literature is a term coined by Espen J. Aarseth, which refers to texts that require little effort from the reader to fully explore. This means the reader isn’t just unreceptively consuming the text: they need to actively participate to unravel meaning and understanding. Aarseth’s concept of ergodic literature changes our understanding of text, reader relationship, and mean-making. ‘Hypertext is not a reconfiguration of narrative but offers an alternative to it.’ (Aarseth 1997).

In ergodic literature, the reader isn’t considered and interpreter, but a participant. They are co-creators. Their choices influence how a piece of work unravels. This concept juxtaposes linear fiction, where the story is the same for every reader. Ergodic literature also challenges the ‘completion’ of linear narrative fiction. Where linear narrative fiction relies on chronology, and at most times, a wrapped-up end, ergodic literature encourages open ended story, fragments, and loops.

To add to that, an ergodic literature writer doesn’t just develop a story and dialogue, they now form structure, choices, and possibilities. They build a narrative in which each choice leads down a different path. They are the architect. 

Aarseth’s theory about ergodic literature in _Cybertext : perspectives on ergodic literature_ (1997) doesn’t just define our understanding of regular literature. It encourages us to go beyond what is considered ‘normal’ Aarseth reframes what a story could be. It opens space for experimental prose and choices, riddles, endless possibilities, and non-linear forms of storytelling that mirrors real life decision making at times. 

Aarseth’s theory validates what I have been doing in my Twine project. I used an already written piece for this project, unfinished though. It was linear, but with Twine, I was able to elevate that experience. I’ve used embedded messages and clues in text that the player has to interact with to reveal. I’ve constructed a passage to make it appear as a newspaper, which the player has to click onto a work to reveal the piece of paper. Decisions like these are what Aarseth has been discussing in his text, that we have the ability as writers to reshape our understanding of literature and go beyond what we already knew.
