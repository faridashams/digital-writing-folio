Read (on top of the weekly readings):

- The kinetic poem ["Taroko Gorge"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=taroko-gorge) 
- The electronic poem ["The Gathering Cloud"](https://luckysoap.com/thegatheringcloud/)
- The hypertext fiction ["First Draft of the Revolution"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=first-draft-of-the-revolution)
- The interactive fiction work ["Shade"](https://pr-if.org/play/shade/)

- "Shade" is much more difficult to interact with so do read the "How to play IF" (link in the top right corner of "Shade") and look at the "Play IF card".


### Reading

Select one work from each volume that you read and for each write:

* What makes the work a piece of digital writing
* A personal response (whether you liked it, how it made you feel &c)
