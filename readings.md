Read (on top of the weekly readings):

- The kinetic poem ["Taroko Gorge"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=taroko-gorge) 
- The electronic poem "The Gathering Cloud"
- The hypertext fiction "First Draft of the Revolution"
- The interactive fiction work "Shade"
- "Shade" is much more difficult to interact with so do read the "How to play IF" (link in the top right corner of "Shade") and look at the "Play IF card".
