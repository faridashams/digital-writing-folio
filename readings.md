Read (on top of the weekly readings):

- The kinetic poem ["Taroko Gorge"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=taroko-gorge) 
- The electronic poem ["The Gathering Cloud"](https://luckysoap.com/thegatheringcloud/)
- The hypertext fiction ["First Draft of the Revolution"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=first-draft-of-the-revolution)
- The interactive fiction work ["Shade"](https://pr-if.org/play/shade/)

- "Shade" is much more difficult to interact with so do read the "How to play IF" (link in the top right corner of "Shade") and look at the "Play IF card".

# Week 5
Espen J. Aarseth, Cybertext : perspectives on ergodic literature (1997)
Aarseth, E, J. (1997). _Cybertext : perspectives on ergodic literature_. Johns Hopkins University Press. 

Ergodic literature is a term coined by Espen J. Aarseth, which refers to texts that require little effort from the reader to fully explore. This means the reader isn’t just unreceptively consuming the text: they need to actively participate to unravel meaning and understanding. Aarseth’s concept of ergodic literature changes our understanding of text, reader relationship, and mean-making. ‘Hypertext is not a reconfiguration of narrative but offers an alternative to it.’ (Aarseth 1997).

In ergodic literature, the reader isn’t considered and interpreter, but a participant. They are co-creators. Their choices influence how a piece of work unravels. This concept juxtaposes linear fiction, where the story is the same for every reader. Ergodic literature also challenges the ‘completion’ of linear narrative fiction. Where linear narrative fiction relies on chronology, and at most times, a wrapped-up end, ergodic literature encourages open ended story, fragments, and loops.

To add to that, an ergodic literature writer doesn’t just develop a story and dialogue, they now form structure, choices, and possibilities. They build a narrative in which each choice leads down a different path. They are the architect. 

Aarseth’s theory about ergodic literature in _Cybertext : perspectives on ergodic literature_ (1997) doesn’t just define our understanding of regular literature. It encourages us to go beyond what is considered ‘normal’ Aarseth reframes what a story could be. It opens space for experimental prose and choices, riddles, endless possibilities, and non-linear forms of storytelling that mirrors real life decision making at times. 

Aarseth’s theory validates what I have been doing in my Twine project. I used an already written piece for this project, unfinished though. It was linear, but with Twine, I was able to elevate that experience. I’ve used embedded messages and clues in text that the player has to interact with to reveal. I’ve constructed a passage to make it appear as a newspaper, which the player has to click onto a work to reveal the piece of paper. Decisions like these are what Aarseth has been discussing in his text, that we have the ability as writers to reshape our understanding of literature and go beyond what we already knew.
