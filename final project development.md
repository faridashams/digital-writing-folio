## What the story is about:
  A story set in 1920s New York, follows a jazz band through their rise and fall. The main protagonist, Estelle Forrest, is the one that tells 
  the narrative, and the user reader gets to follow her journey through her journal entries, in which you see her make the decision to leave her hometown, and how she meets her fellow bandmates and the relationships she creates with them.

## How I came up with my idea:
  This is a story I had been working on for some time now. I had written many different versions of it to see exactly which 
  path I want to take this story. It came to my benefit now with this assignement project. I thought it was the perfect story 
  to turn into an electronic story through Twine. It can be interactive, engaging, and the user reader could have a hand in how 
  the story moves along. I had spoken to one of my peers about my idea, and we started throwing suggestions back and forth until I had finalised how I wanted this story to take shape.

## Issues I faced while creating the story on Twine:
  1. Files not saving properly and my project not showing up. I was saving it on the wrong file in github. It was named differently than the folder on my desktop. 
  2. The font not working because I was viewing my project through "Test From Here" option.
  3. Having difficulty trying to add a background image to a passage. I tried many different codes that kept glitching until finally one of them worked. 

### Elements that were different from presentation to final project.

  * The idea stayed the same, though the original journal entry titles changed over time.
  * I originally had 19 passages, I now have 29 passages.
  * I had a specific palette that consisted of reds, greens, and golds, but I decided to make it all black and white to fit the vintage aesthetic, though I kept the red in the dialogue.
  * I added in different stylistic choices over time that were suggested to me: scratching out sentences, adding a drop shadow to the text, changing the opacity of the background image, adding an image map as the journal entries.
