### What the story is about:
A story set in 1920s New York, follows a jazz band through their rise and fall. The main protagonist, Estelle Forrest, is the one that tells 
the narrative, and the user reader gets to follow her journey through her journal entries, in which you see her make the decision to leave her
hometown, and how she meets her fellow bandmates and the relationships she creates with them.

### How I came up with my idea:
This is a story I had been working on for some time now. I had written many different versions of it to see exactly which 
path I want to take this story. It came to my benefit now with this assignement project. I thought it was the perfect story 
to turn into an electronic story through Twine. It can be interactive, engaging, and the user reader could have a hand in how 
the story moves along. I had spoken to one of my peers about my idea, and we started throwing suggestions back and forth until I had finalised 
how I wanted this story to take shape.

### Issues I faced while creating the story on Twine:
1. Files not saving properly and my project not showing up
2. The font not working because I was viewing my project through "Test From Here" option.
