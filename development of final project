### How I came up with my idea:
  This is a story I had been working on for some time now. I had written many different versions of it to see exactly which path I want to take this story. It came to my benefit now with this assignement project. I thought it was the perfect story to turn into an electronic story through Twine. It can be interactive, engaging, and the user reader could have a hand in how the story moves along.
