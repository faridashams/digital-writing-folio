### Reflection on week 1 coding.

I didn't have many expecations going in this class, I was hoping it would not be too difficult as I don't have much coding knowledge beyond year 7 classes in school. I had used html coding before, so that was familiar to me. However, Github and Glitch are entirely new softwares to me that I hope become easier to use the more I practice. I'm very intrigued by how coding is intercepted with writing, especially with how it could look on a page. I'm excited to learn more and to have coding as a skill I could have an advantage for. 

### Your Writing

- What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?
- What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
- Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?
- How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?
