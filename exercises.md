### Reflection on week 1 coding.

I didn't have many expecations going in this class, I was hoping it would not be too difficult as I don't have much coding knowledge beyond year 7 classes in school. I had used html coding before, so that was familiar to me. However, Github and Glitch are entirely new softwares to me that I hope become easier to use the more I practice. I'm very intrigued by how coding is intercepted with writing, especially with how it could look on a page. I'm excited to learn more and to have coding as a skill I could have an advantage for. 

### Your Writing

- What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?
  * I mostly write fiction but have found a new love and interest for creative nonfiction since taking its classes in second year.
- What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
  * For techniques, I use handwritting and my notebook as tool for all my writing.  
- Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?
  * It is a technique that has proved itself effective and I find I get high quality writing with this technique.
- How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?
  * It facilitates my writing with how i use this technique to edit. After the second draft in my notebook, I move onto the word documenet, and when I rewrite, I edit as I go instead of going back and deleting phrases. I realise it has improved my writing, and is a much faster way to edit in my opinion.


### Third Generation Electronic Literature reading by Leonardo Flores

* First Gen Literature, known as the <u>classic</u>, fisrt established in 1952. First Gen Literature is defined as pre-web, text-heavy, link driven, and mostly hypertext, that still operated with many paradigms established in print.
* Second Gen Literature, known as the <u>contemporary</u>, began in 1995 and onwards. Second Gen Literature is defined as Web based and incorporating multimedia and interactivity, intertwined with hypertext link?
* Third Gen Literature, which is the current age and the technology we are expierencing today, established in 2005. Third Gen Literature uses established platforms with massive user bases, such as social media networks, apps, mobile and touchscreen devices, and Web API services. It coexists with the Second Gen and accounts for a massive scale of born digital work produced by and for contemporary audiences for whom digital media has become naturalized.

# Week 3
An algorithim is a set of rules. It has to be designed. It is based on human intelligence.
A constraint: a limitation or a constriction. A fiction writer is constrained about choosing what to say and withold information. A scriptwriter is constrained by script. A short story writer is constrained by word count. A poet is constrained by rhythm, constraining yourself to a specific voice: formal toning, syllables, lines.
