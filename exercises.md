## Week 1 Reflection.

I didn't have many expecations going in this class, I was hoping it would not be too difficult as I don't have much coding knowledge beyond year 7 classes in school. I had used html coding before, so that was familiar to me. However, Github and Glitch are entirely new softwares to me that I hope become easier to use the more I practice. I'm very intrigued by how coding is intercepted with writing, especially with how it could look on a page. I'm excited to learn more and to have coding as a skill I could have an advantage for. 

### Your Writing

- What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?
  * I mostly write fiction but have found a new love and interest for creative nonfiction since taking its classes in second year.
- What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
  * For techniques, I use handwritting and my notebook as tool for all my writing.  
- Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?
  * It is a technique that has proved itself effective and I find I get high quality writing with this technique.
- How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?
  * It facilitates my writing with how i use this technique to edit. After the second draft in my notebook, I move onto the word documenet, and when I rewrite, I edit as I go instead of going back and deleting phrases. I realise it has improved my writing, and is a much faster way to edit in my opinion.


### Third Generation Electronic Literature reading by Leonardo Flores

* First Gen Literature, known as the _classic_, fisrt established in 1952. First Gen Literature is defined as pre-web, text-heavy, link driven, and mostly hypertext, that still operated with many paradigms established in print.
* Second Gen Literature, known as the _contemporary_, began in 1995 and onwards. Second Gen Literature is defined as Web based and incorporating multimedia and interactivity, intertwined with hypertext link?
* Third Gen Literature, which is the current age and the technology we are expierencing today, established in 2005. Third Gen Literature uses established platforms with massive user bases, such as social media networks, apps, mobile and touchscreen devices, and Web API services. It coexists with the Second Gen and accounts for a massive scale of born digital work produced by and for contemporary audiences for whom digital media has become naturalized.

## Week 3 Reflection.

### Algorithim: 
- Algorithim is a set of rules. It has to be designed. It is based on human intelligence.
  
### Constraint: 
- Constraint is a limitation.
- A fiction writer is constrained about choosing what to say in the story and which information to and withold.
- A scriptwriter is constrained by script and form.
- A short story writer is constrained by word count.
- A poet is constrained by rhythm, and limiting themseleves to: a specific voice, formal toning, syllables, lines.

## Lipograms
- A poem without the letter e:
  I was sitting on the grass, balancing a pink lunchbox on my lap. It was adorned in frilly fabric. I was a month shy of turning IX, and it was the first day I saw him.


## Week 6 activity 
["_House On The Hill_"](https://larajscuri.github.io/house-on-the-hill/) by Lara J Scuri 
 
- How does it work?
 * The user reader can move the character around the house using up down side side and wasd keys.
 * There are interactive elements within the home, which include the televesion, broken glass on the floor, picture frames.
 * Different characters can be found throughout the house which the player can interact with to progress the story.
 * Text appears on the screen as if being typed, but you can press any key to complete the sentence faster and then skip to the next line. 
 
- What does it do?
 * The work builds suspense and tension.
 * Haunting music can be heard in the background, it loops.
 * Phone calls, a shrilling ringing sound, gives more context to some characters and lets the user reader piece together the familiam issues.
 * Nostalgic, the colour scheme of blues and the pixelation gives the work a feel of 80's video games.
 
- What is conveyed?
 * A haunted house with thrilling drama.
 * Family secrets can be uncovered slowly throughout the exploration of the house and the conversations the user reader has with the characters.
 * A question I have: is it a random house that she stumbled upon? Is it her estranged's family's house that she went back to after a long time of absence to escape her family's secrets?
 
- Digital Affordance:
 * Gradual discovery of interactive elements increases the suspense, reader immersion, and interest.
 * Certrain elements add to the story; blood on the floor, broken picture frames, and adjar door. It is up to the reader to discover them.
 * The work is designed to be read in different orders, depending on order of rooms entered.
 * How the work functions increases the meaning.
 
- Between readings:
 * The user reader can change the order in which they read the work.
 * The work has a singular ending.
 * Images prompt storyline progression via the user reader’s interaction with certain pieces/items/characteristics/characters of the environment.
 
- Movement:
 * Reader takes an active role in progressing the story.
 * The story will remain static and unmoving without the user reader's interactions.
 
## Week 8
Reflection on Feedback and Peer Presentations Required activity for final folio (can be completed anytime this week)

What has been introduced? Summarise your proposed piece
- My proposed idea is a murder mystery narrative set in 1920s New York, where main protaginst, Estelle, recounts through her journal
entries how she established her career in the music industry, and the mystery that hangs around her ensemble of friends.

What are the themes and ideas is your piece is exploring?:
- The themes that revolve around my piece is betrayel, dangerous love, obsession, greed, murder, and manipulation. 
  
What literary genre or style are you drawing on? Is it narrative driven or more poetic and associative? Or essayistic?
- My genre is murder mystery, and it is narrative driven. I'm drawing inspiration from The Secret History by Donna Tartt.
  
Succinctly: What is the story? Or, what do you want to express/communicate through this piece?
what do you wish there reader to understand of feel?
- I want to express through my story that some kinds of obession, once it reaches it limit, is dangerouns. I want to express how meeting
one person can change your entire life, whether that be could good or bad. I also want to communicate the lengths someone could go
in order to reach success.

# What needs to be developed?

What drives the reader’s momentum through the piece?
- The mystery is what drives the reader's momentum. I intend to keep the reader on their toes to figure out not only _who died_, but why did they die. I want the reader to be able to figure out themselves what is Estelle's intentions. 

How does the digital feed into this momentum?
- I've actively used the (click:append) macro to move the narrative along. I've used this code to hide embedded phrases and clues
that reveales Estelle's main intentions, and how she actually is, and what she thinks of her friends beneath the surface. 

How does the literary and the digital drive the momentum together with the piece’s thematics?
- The reader will start to piece together the story themselves through the clues and embedded phrases. These phrases are what moves the narrative along. The digital codes are also a way to get to know the characters on a deeper level. I have also used background images and audio to help the reader feel as if they were in New York themselves, and to give the reader a bigger scope into the flapper and speakeasy lifestyle that made the 1920s era.  

Do you need to develop the story/concept/narrative further in order to answer the above questions? how will you do this? By mapping? By writing it out?
- I have thouroughly developed the concept and narrative via making a digital map of the idea, character backgrounds and arcs, the themes, aesthetics, and audios I aim to use. This is a tool in order to help me the more I code the story so that I don't get lost along the way and to be completely certain of what I am creating. 

## Scope and Scale

How many words will it be?
- A couple thousand words, I'll have to double check and answer this question again.
  
How many screens?
- At the moment I've got nineteen passages, but it could increase the more I code my story.
  
What do you need to do on a week-by-week basis (is this realistic?)
- I would like to code more week by week until I get the full scale of the story. And just expriement early with codes in case I get stuck on any of them so I have time to fix the codes.
  
What is the tech that might get you stuck? what is the workaround/Plan B?
- I have been able to solve all the tech issues I have faced, but if I face anymore, which is likely, I'll add it to my folio development and work hard on trying to solve it.
Discuss what we learnt about and what interested you.

## Week 10: Reflection on class and final project 

Were there any portions of the class that stood out to you?
- The coding in itself stood out. It seemed like such a difficult language to learn and incredibly out of reach for me. Using Twine is what stood out to me the most. I found it confusing at the start, however, the more I practised, the more I started to find pleasure of it. The feeling of satisfaction of working code is a feeling I find myself craving the more I work on my Twine project.
  
Was there anything that you were able to expand your prior knowledge on?
- Before this class, I had very minimal understanding of HTML code since I learnt it in years 5 and 6. But with this class, I realised that coding goes beyond just HTML, and that there is so much more of it that I had no idea about. What I find interesting is that Twine does depend a lot on simple HTML code, and I found it is what easily read by Twine, so being able to fall back to codes I already knew whenever I got stuck was comforting to me.

Discuss your final project and how it may relate back to your initial interests in the class or what we have learnt.
-

What has inspired your final project?
-

What knowledge from this studio are you using to create this final project?
- 

Discuss how this studio has impacted your writing practice.
- 

Is interactive fiction something that you will continue to do after this studio?
- I'm not so sure if it is something I will continue to do after this studio, but I have gained a new respect for it. 

Has learning about and experimenting with interactive fiction influenced how you approach writing as a whole?
-
