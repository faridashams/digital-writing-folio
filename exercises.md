I didn't have many expecations going in this class, I was hoping it would not be too difficult as I don't have much coding knowledge beyond year 7 classes in school. I had used html coding before, so that was familiar to me. However, Github and Glitch are entirely new softwares to me that I hope become easier to use the more I practice. I'm very intrigued by how coding is intercepted with writing, especially with how it could look on a page. I'm excited to learn more and to have coding as a skill I could have an advantage for. 

### Your Writing

- What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?
  * I mostly write fiction but have found a new love and interest for creative nonfiction since taking its classes in second year.
- What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
  * For techniques, I use handwritting and my notebook as tool for all my writing.  
- Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?
  * It is a technique that has proved itself effective and I find I get high quality writing with this technique.
- How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?
  * It facilitates my writing with how i use this technique to edit. After the second draft in my notebook, I move onto the word documenet, and when I rewrite, I edit as I go instead of going back and deleting phrases. I realise it has improved my writing, and is a much faster way to edit in my opinion.


### Third Generation Electronic Literature reading by Leonardo Flores

* First Gen Literature, known as the _classic_, fisrt established in 1952. First Gen Literature is defined as pre-web, text-heavy, link driven, and mostly hypertext, that still operated with many paradigms established in print.
* Second Gen Literature, known as the _contemporary_, began in 1995 and onwards. Second Gen Literature is defined as Web based and incorporating multimedia and interactivity, intertwined with hypertext link?
* Third Gen Literature, which is the current age and the technology we are expierencing today, established in 2005. Third Gen Literature uses established platforms with massive user bases, such as social media networks, apps, mobile and touchscreen devices, and Web API services. It coexists with the Second Gen and accounts for a massive scale of born digital work produced by and for contemporary audiences for whom digital media has become naturalized.

## Week 3 Reflection.

We have experimented on Glitch and remixed a readymade project to our liking. At first, I found it difficult to follow the teacher’s instructions. Everything felt too foreign for me. I was scared to test out the codes because I learned too quickly how sensitive they could be. Three hours in class practicing and I slowly felt myself start becoming comfortable with the language. I enjoyed how the options to customise the Glitch page was almost endless. I could change the solid background colour to gradient, I could delete the gif and add an image instead, I had great fun changing the fonts and colour of the text. I do think coding will get difficult as the semester goes on, especially with the software we’ll use, but I am sure I’ll find myself navigating it as I did this one.


### Algorithim: 
- Algorithim is a set of rules. It has to be designed. It is based on human intelligence.
  
### Constraint: 
 * Constraint is a limitation.
 *  A fiction writer is constrained about choosing what to say in the story and which information to and withold.
 *  A scriptwriter is constrained by script and form.
 *  A short story writer is constrained by word count.
 *  A poet is constrained by rhythm, and limiting themseleves to: a specific voice, formal toning, syllables, lines.
  
Dada, Opuilo, the modernists.
Algorithmic writing 

### Lipograms
 *  A short poem without the letter e:
  
_I was sitting on the grass, balancing a pink lunchbox on my lap. 
 adorned in frilly fabric. I was a month shy of turning IX, 
 and it was the first day I saw him._

## Week 5 

We have started developing our works for the final creative work. I have chosen to work with Twine since I believe it is what fits the image in my head for my project. I know which of my projects I want to develop for Twine. It’s a 1920s mystery story set in New York, and with Twine, I’ll be able to embed hidden clues and meanings, though I am still unsure on how I’m going to do that or what code I could use. I designed a digital map to help me picture my story and its themes better. 

<img width="924" alt="Screen Shot 2025-05-15 at 2 59 05 pm" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ecfe79e-f8aa-41ff-8ed7-c0b89d7b3019" />

I’ve added here all the character names, their relations to each other, their role in the band, and their backstories. I have also gone in depth with the themes I want to incorporate, alongside a general idea of how I think the story will progress. I’ve written the titles of the journal entries, and a colour palette, though I believe that might change the more I develop the story. 

## Week 6 activity 
["_House On The Hill_"](https://larajscuri.github.io/house-on-the-hill/) by Lara J Scuri 
 
- How does it work?
  
   *  The user reader can move the character around the house using up down side side and wasd keys.
   *  There are interactive elements within the home, which include the television, broken glass on the floor, picture frames.
   *  Different characters can be found throughout the house which the player can interact with to progress the story.
   *  Text appears on the screen as if being typed, but you can press any key to complete the sentence faster and then skip to the next line. 
 
- What does it do?
  
   *  The work builds suspense and tension.
   *  Haunting music can be heard in the background, it loops.
   *  Phone calls, a shrilling ringing sound, gives more context to some characters and lets the user reader piece together the familial issues.
   *  Nostalgic, the colour scheme of blues and the pixelation gives the work a feel of 80's video games.
 
- What is conveyed?
  
   *  A haunted house with thrilling drama.
   *  Family secrets can be uncovered slowly throughout the exploration of the house and the conversations the user reader has with the characters.
   *  A question I have: is it a random house that she stumbled upon? Is it her estranged's family's house that she went back to after a long time of absence to escape her family's secrets?
 
- Digital Affordance:
  
   *  Gradual discovery of interactive elements increases the suspense, reader immersion, and interest.
   *  Certrain elements add to the story; blood on the floor, broken picture frames, and adjar door. It is up to the reader to discover them.
   *  The work is designed to be read in different orders, depending on order of rooms entered.
   *  How the work functions increases the meaning.
 
- Between readings:
  
   *  The user reader can change the order in which they read the work.
   *  The work has a singular ending.
   *  Images prompt storyline progression via the user reader’s interaction with certain pieces/items/characteristics/characters of the environment.
 
- Movement:
  
   *  Reader takes an active role in progressing the story.
   *  The story will remain static and unmoving without the user reader's interactions.

- How does this work make you reflect on your own ideas and what you might do for your own piece?
  
  * This work also dives deep into secrets and mysteries, and it uses embedded clues in objects that are clickable: it reveals more of the story. This idea is similar to mine. It made me think of how I can use clues and hidden secrecy around in my Twine project. My piece doesn’t use objects like this creative work per say. It doesn’t have clickable broken glass you can click onto, but it has clickable dialogue and scratched out words that reveal more than an object could. I took in what _House on the Hill_ did with its own secrets, and meshed it to become what I would use in my own piece.

    _House on the Hill_ also used one continuous audio throughout the game. It was a suspenseful tune that put me on the edge of my seat while I was reading. It enhanced the experience for me. I wanted to do something similar as well. Since my piece is very heavily jazz and crime inspired, I think I’ll add audio that resembles that. Perhaps a jazz song while the troupe performs, or a crime theme song once the work begins. I also wanted to add in audio in the background to match whatever is happening on screen. For example, if someone is having a conversation, I want chatter to play in the back. If people are fighting or eating breakfast or singing, I want the audio to resemble exactly that. So, using the same idea from _House on the Hill_ of having audio that matches, but enhancing it even more to make it a full rounded experience for the player. I haven’t found suitable audio yet, but I’m working on it.
 
## Week 8
##### Reflection on Feedback and Peer Presentations:

I planned for this presentation for days. I was determined to do well in it, and show my peers the work I had been developing for weeks. I think my main concern for this presentation was to at least have 4 pages of prototype ready to show the class for feedback. I worked hard to get that prepared, alongside diving into any troubleshooting issues I faced. One of my other main concerns was the text being too long and difficult to read, and fonts that didn’t exactly match the aesthetic I was going for. Marley suggested I download fonts from DaFont instead of Google Fonts, since they have more options for handwritten fonts like I wanted. Then Jenny suggested I change the opacity of the background image, and to add a drop shadow to the text to make it stand out. Jenny also suggested I add an image map for the journal entries to make it more immersive and realistic to interact with. Here are two images of me implementing those changes:

<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2025-06-05 at 8 47 41 pm" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d89394e-c9ba-4684-81db-3e6ef4a3ada4" />

<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2025-06-05 at 8 47 58 pm" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e8cd879-7745-4c85-8476-ee9a89e4120f" />


What has been introduced? Summarise your proposed piece
 
   * My proposed idea is a murder mystery narrative set in 1920s New York, where main protagonist, Estelle, recounts through her journal entries how she established her career in the music industry, and the mystery that hangs around her ensemble of friends.

What are the themes and ideas is your piece is exploring?:

 *	The themes that revolve around my piece is betrayal, dangerous love, obsession, greed, murder, and manipulation.

What literary genre or style are you drawing on? Is it narrative driven or more poetic and associative? Or essayistic?

 *	My genre is murder mystery, and it is narrative driven. I'm drawing inspiration from The Secret History by Donna Tartt and The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald.
  
Succinctly: What is the story? Or, what do you want to express/communicate through this piece?
what do you wish there reader to understand of feel?
 
  * I want to express through my story that some kinds of obsession, once it reaches it limit, is dangerous. I want to express how meeting one person can change your entire life, whether that be could good or bad. I also want to communicate the lengths someone could go in order to reach success.

# What needs to be developed?

What drives the reader’s momentum through the piece?
 
 * The mystery is what drives the reader's momentum. I intend to keep the reader on their toes to figure out not only who died, but why did they die. I want the reader to be able to figure out themselves what is Estelle's intentions.

How does the digital feed into this momentum?
 
  * I've actively used the (click:append) macro to move the narrative along. I've used this code to hide embedded phrases and clues that reveals Estelle's main intentions, and how she actually is, and what she thinks of her friends beneath the surface.

How does the literary and the digital drive the momentum together with the piece’s thematics?
 
  * The reader will start to piece together the story themselves through the clues and embedded phrases. These phrases are what moves the narrative along. The digital codes are also a way to get to know the characters on a deeper level. I have also used background images and audio to help the reader feel as if they were in New York themselves, and to give the reader a bigger scope into the flapper and speakeasy lifestyle that made the 1920s era.

Do you need to develop the story/concept/narrative further in order to answer the above questions? how will you do this? By mapping? By writing it out?
 
  * I have thoroughly developed the concept and narrative via making a digital map of the idea, character backgrounds and arcs, the themes, aesthetics, and audios I aim to use. This is a tool in order to help me the more I code the story so that I don't get lost along the way and to be completely certain of what I am creating.

#### Scope and Scale

How many words will it be?
 *  A couple thousand words, I'll have to double check and answer this question again.
     Update, June 5th: it is 8,872 words. 
  
How many screens?
 *  At the moment I've got nineteen passages, but it could increase the more I code my story.
     Update, June 5th: I've got 29 passages.
  
What do you need to do on a week-by-week basis (is this realistic?)
 *  I would like to code more week by week until I get the full scale of the story. And just expriement early with codes in case I get stuck on any of them so I have time to fix the codes.
  
What is the tech that might get you stuck? what is the workaround/Plan B?
 *  I have been able to solve all the tech issues I have faced, but if I face anymore, which is likely, I'll add it to my folio development and work hard on trying to solve it.

## Week 9: Reflection on Workshopping

-	Workshop feedback I was given:

At the time of workshopping, my creative piece was still half unfinished, though I did have a full image in my mind of how I wanted it to look like in the end, that is why at first, I was unsure what I wanted feedback on. I started the discussion with giving my peers an overview of what my piece was about and what it entailed. Then I shared a concern with how I thought my code might have been too simple, or that I was reusing the same codes over and over again. I also shared an issue I was having. I wanted the dialogue to be clickable, but I couldn’t manage how to do it.

Liv suggested a beginner friendly website by Damon L. Wakes that had a section for using variables. I thought it was a wonderful idea, and I tried it out, but I realised it wasn’t exactly what I was going for. My story didn’t require many interactive clues, so using variables wasn’t for me.

Angelo suggested I use the (t8n-delay: 2s) + (t8n: "fade") code to give my project something more exciting like I intended. I loved the idea and I immediately put it to the test. I used it the most in my passage titled Realisations. I used both the fade and fade down codes, and timed it so when the player finishes reading the sentence, another one will appear after. Though, I believe this one just depends on the person’s reading speed.

I found this workshopping incredibly helpful since I thought it was one of the things missing from the course that we needed to indulge in, but I believe this workshopping round came at a good time because it helped develop my work.


## Week 10: Reflection on class and final project 

Were there any portions of the class that stood out to you?

 * The coding in itself stood out. It seemed like such a difficult language to learn and incredibly out of reach for me. Using Twine is what stood out to me the most. I found it confusing at the start, however, the more I practised, the more I started to find pleasure of it. The feeling of satisfaction of working code is a feeling I find myself craving the more I work on my Twine project.
  
Was there anything that you were able to expand your prior knowledge on?
 *  Before this class, I had very minimal understanding of HTML code since I learnt it in years 5 and 6. But with this class, I realised that coding goes beyond just HTML, and that there is so much more of it that I had no idea about. What I find interesting is that Twine does depend a lot on simple HTML code, and I found it is what easily read by Twine, so being able to fall back to codes I already knew whenever I got stuck was comforting to me.

Discuss your final project and how it may relate back to your initial interests in the class or what we have learnt.
-

What has inspired your final project?
-

What knowledge from this studio are you using to create this final project?
- 

Discuss how this studio has impacted your writing practice.
- 

Is interactive fiction something that you will continue to do after this studio?
- I'm not so sure if it is something I will continue to do after this studio, but I have gained a new respect for it. 

Has learning about and experimenting with interactive fiction influenced how you approach writing as a whole?
- 

## Final reflection on class and entire process with working with Twine:

I have always found coding to be an impressive language to learn. It seemed so far out of my reach, and I found whoever had mastered the language must have been the smartest person alive. Taking this course was a huge leap of faith. I didn’t know what to expect or how the class was going to run. It was extremely out of my comfort zone. However, one thing that I am, is that I am persistent, and I will try my absolute hardest to make something work for me. It must have been why I found working with Twine to be immensely rewarding. I chose to work Twine because it aligned perfectly with the story idea I had in mind. It was the perfect software to use for an interactive story. I remember when we first play tested with Twine, I immediately found it fun, and many ideas came to mind of what I could do with it for my final project. 

Twine definitely came with its fair share of frustrations. There were many moments where I was very stuck with the code, and I felt a lot of anger and annoyance towards that inanimate object. My biggest issue at first was adding a background image, which took me three days to solve, then an even bigger issue arouse with my image map because it wouldn’t scale properly, and when I tried to size it up, the coordinates would change and be incorrect. That was definitely the most frustrating thing to solve, and I left it as the last thing to work on to really give myself a clear head on how I was going to fix it. Again, I am nothing if not persistent, and I did fix the issue, and the sense of satisfaction I felt was immeasurable. 

I think the main thing that truly got me through this class was my persistence of making things work, even if it felt impossible. If a certain idea I wanted to work didn’t, I would either find a loophole, or change it slightly to fit the code instead. Finishing my Twine project and adding that final touch and play testing it with everything working, was incredible. I took a breath as I clicked ‘Test from here’, and I held my breath the entire time I played it to make sure everything was working perfectly, and I finally let out that breath when I realised the code was flawless, and I was truly and officially done with my project. 

Months and months of work on this Twine project was gruelling, but I am so incredibly proud of the work I have done. If I could go back in time, I would take this class again, because it allowed me to prove myself wrong: I could learn code. I am capable. And it made me learn to be patient, and that if I can’t see a solution now, it doesn’t mean one will never come to me. It has influenced my writing in a way I didn’t think was possible. It allowed me to be experimental, and I now have a newfound love for electronic literature. This was both an intense and a fulfilling experience.
