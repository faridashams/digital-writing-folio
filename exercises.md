## Week 1 Reflection.

I didn't have many expecations going in this class, I was hoping it would not be too difficult as I don't have much coding knowledge beyond year 7 classes in school. I had used html coding before, so that was familiar to me. However, Github and Glitch are entirely new softwares to me that I hope become easier to use the more I practice. I'm very intrigued by how coding is intercepted with writing, especially with how it could look on a page. I'm excited to learn more and to have coding as a skill I could have an advantage for. 

### Your Writing

- What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?
  * I mostly write fiction but have found a new love and interest for creative nonfiction since taking its classes in second year.
- What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
  * For techniques, I use handwritting and my notebook as tool for all my writing.  
- Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?
  * It is a technique that has proved itself effective and I find I get high quality writing with this technique.
- How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?
  * It facilitates my writing with how i use this technique to edit. After the second draft in my notebook, I move onto the word documenet, and when I rewrite, I edit as I go instead of going back and deleting phrases. I realise it has improved my writing, and is a much faster way to edit in my opinion.


### Third Generation Electronic Literature reading by Leonardo Flores

* First Gen Literature, known as the _classic_, fisrt established in 1952. First Gen Literature is defined as pre-web, text-heavy, link driven, and mostly hypertext, that still operated with many paradigms established in print.
* Second Gen Literature, known as the _contemporary_, began in 1995 and onwards. Second Gen Literature is defined as Web based and incorporating multimedia and interactivity, intertwined with hypertext link?
* Third Gen Literature, which is the current age and the technology we are expierencing today, established in 2005. Third Gen Literature uses established platforms with massive user bases, such as social media networks, apps, mobile and touchscreen devices, and Web API services. It coexists with the Second Gen and accounts for a massive scale of born digital work produced by and for contemporary audiences for whom digital media has become naturalized.

## Week 3 Reflection.

### Algorithim: 
- Algorithim is a set of rules. It has to be designed. It is based on human intelligence.
  
### Constraint: 
- Constraint is a limitation.
- A fiction writer is constrained about choosing what to say in the story and which information to and withold.
- A scriptwriter is constrained by script and form.
- A short story writer is constrained by word count.
- A poet is constrained by rhythm, and limiting themseleves to: a specific voice, formal toning, syllables, lines.

## Week 6 activity 
["_House On The Hill_"](https://larajscuri.github.io/house-on-the-hill/) by Lara J Scuri 
 
- How does it work?
 * The user reader can move the character around the house using up down side side and wasd keys.
 * There are interactive elements within the home, which include the televesion, broken glass on the floor, picture frames.
 * Different characters can be found throughout the house which the player can interact with to progress the story.
 * Text appears on the screen as if being typed, but you can press any key to complete the sentence faster and then skip to the next line. 
 
- What does it do?
 * The work builds suspense and tension.
 * Haunting music can be heard in the background, it loops.
 * Phone calls, a shrilling ringing sound, gives more context to some characters and lets the user reader piece together the familiam issues.
 * Nostalgic, the colour scheme of blues and the pixelation gives the work a feel of 80's video games.
 
- What is conveyed?
 * A haunted house with thrilling drama.
 * Family secrets can be uncovered slowly throughout the exploration of the house and the conversations the user reader has with the characters.
 * A question I have: is it a random house that she stumbled upon? Is it her estranged's family's house that she went back to after a long time of absence to escape her family's secrets?
 
- Digital Affordance:
 * Gradual discovery of interactive elements increases the suspense, reader immersion, and interest.
 * Certrain elements add to the story; blood on the floor, broken picture frames, and adjar door. It is up to the reader to discover them.
 * The work is designed to be read in different orders, depending on order of rooms entered.
 * How the work functions increases the meaning.
 
- Between readings:
 * The user reader can change the order in which they read the work.
 * The work has a singular ending.
 * Images prompt storyline progression via the user readerâ€™s interaction with certain pieces/items/characteristics/characters of the environment.
 
- Movement:
 * Reader takes an active role in progressing the story.
 * The story will remain static and unmoving without the user reader's interactions.
